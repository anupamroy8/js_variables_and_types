## If Statement
1.  🎖Make a simple calculator with these functions. Using prompt, type conversion, if else statement. Use prompt to take the input from user i.e two numbers and an operation (Add, Sub, Mul, Div).

  ⛑ Rule
    * [ ] While substracting and dividing keep in mind the number one should be greater then number two. If not show alert saying `Number Two is larger then Number one`.
  ⚡️ Operations
    * [ ] Add
    * [ ] Sub
    * [ ] Mul
    * [ ] Div

//
var value1 = Number(prompt("Enter first number"));
var value2 = Number(prompt("Enter second number"));
alert("You need to type the operation: add or mul or sub or div");
var operation = prompt("Enter operation");
if(operation=="add"){
    alert(value1+value2);
}
else if(operation=="mul"){
    alert(value1*value2);
}
else if(operation=="sub"){
    if(value1<value2){ alert("First number must be greater");
    }
    else alert(value1-value2);
}
else if(operation=="div") {
    if(value1<value2){ alert("First number must be greater");
                     }
    else alert(value1/value2);
}
//

2. 🎖Write a if else statement which checks if the status is single `console.log` the message `John is single` or else `John is married`
```js
var firstName = 'John';
var status = 'single';
// Your code goes here
var firstName = 'John';
var status = 'single';
if (status == 'single')
   console.log("John is signle");
else
    console.log("John is married");
```

3. 🎖Write a JavaScript program that takes two `integers` from user (using prompt) and alerts the larger number.
```js
// your code goes here
var a = prompt("Enter the first number");
var b = prompt("Enter the second number");
if(a>b) 
alert (a+ " is the larger number");
else 
alert(b+ " is the larger number");
```

4. 🎖Write a JavaScript conditional statement to find the sign (+, -) of product of three numbers. Take those three numbers from user using `prompt`. Display an alert box with the specified sign.

```js
// Your code goes here
var a = Number(prompt("Enter the first number"));
var b = Number(prompt("Enter the second number"));
var c = Number(prompt("Enter the third number"));
var mul = (a*b*c);
if(mul>=0)
alert("+");
else
alert("-");
```

## Switch Statement

1. 🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take a number value from user and alert the message if it matches the conditions.
* [ ] ONE, if `number` is equal to 1.
* [ ] TWO, if `number` is equal to 2.
* [ ] THREE, if `number` is equal to 3.
* [ ] FOUR, if `number` is equal to 4.
* [ ] FIVE, if `number` is equal to 5.
* [ ] SIX, if `number` is equal to 6.
* [ ] SEVEN, if `number` is equal to 7.
* [ ] EIGHT, if `number` is equal to 8.
* [ ] NINE, if `number` is equal to 9.
* [ ] PLEASE TRY AGAIN, if  is none of the above.
```js
// Your code goes here
```

2. 🎖Using switch statement do the following

Take the value of `marks` (0-100) from user using `prompt` and `alert` the message (Your Grade is AA) as giver below.
* [ ] `AA` if `marks` is greater than 90.
* [ ] `AB` if `marks` is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90
* [ ] `BB` if `marks` is greater than 70 and less than or equal to 80
* [ ] `BC` if `marks` is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70
* [ ] `CC` if `marks` is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60
* [ ] `CD` if `marks` is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50
* [ ] `DD` if `marks` is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40
* [ ] `FF` if `marks` is less than or equal to 30
```js
// Your code goes here
```
